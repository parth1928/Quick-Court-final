# MongoDB Booking System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

As an expert MongoDB developer, I've implemented a comprehensive, robust booking system for your Quick Court platform that fully integrates with your existing tech stack and provides a scalable foundation for production use.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Tech Stack Alignment
- **Next.js 15.2.4** with TypeScript for full-stack development
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM for flexible document storage
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions
- **RESTful API** design following Next.js App Router conventions

### Database Schema Design

#### 1. Enhanced Booking Model (`/models/BookingEnhanced.ts`)

**Core Features:**
- **Flexible References:** User, Court, and Venue relationships with proper indexing
- **Time Management:** Comprehensive start/end time handling with duration calculations
- **Status Tracking:** Multi-state booking lifecycle (pending ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí completed/cancelled)
- **Financial Integrity:** Detailed pricing breakdown with tax, fees, and refund tracking
- **Payment Integration:** Support for multiple payment methods and statuses
- **User Experience:** Check-in/out functionality, reviews, and ratings
- **Audit Trail:** Complete metadata tracking for compliance and debugging

**Key Indexes for Performance:**
```javascript
// Compound indexes for optimal query performance
{ court: 1, startTime: 1, endTime: 1 }     // Conflict detection
{ user: 1, status: 1, startTime: -1 }      // User booking history
{ venue: 1, startTime: -1 }                // Venue analytics
{ status: 1, startTime: 1 }                // Status-based queries
{ 'payment.status': 1, createdAt: -1 }     // Payment tracking
```

**Business Logic Validation:**
- Prevents overlapping bookings on the same court
- Enforces minimum cancellation windows (2 hours)
- Auto-calculates pricing with taxes and platform fees
- Validates booking time constraints

#### 2. API Architecture

**Primary Endpoints:**

1. **`GET /api/users/me/bookings`** - Comprehensive booking retrieval
   - Advanced filtering (status, date range, pagination)
   - Populated venue and court details
   - Real-time statistics calculation
   - Optimized queries with lean() for performance

2. **`POST /api/users/me/bookings`** - Secure booking creation
   - Thorough validation and conflict checking
   - Automatic pricing calculations
   - Payment integration ready
   - Transaction-safe operations

3. **`PATCH /api/users/me/bookings/[id]`** - Booking management
   - Cancel with refund calculation
   - Review and rating system
   - Check-in/check-out functionality
   - Status transition validation

4. **`GET /api/users/me/bookings/[id]`** - Detailed booking view
   - Complete booking information
   - Venue and court details
   - Action availability (cancel, review, etc.)

## üöÄ Frontend Integration

### Profile Page Enhancement (`/app/profile/page.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Real-time Data:** Fetches actual bookings from API instead of static data
- **Enhanced Statistics:** Total bookings, upcoming, completed, and total spent
- **Interactive Features:** Cancel bookings with confirmation
- **Status Management:** Proper status labels and color coding
